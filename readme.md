# Simple SVG

[Modern browsers now support svg for favicon](https://web.dev/building-an-adaptive-favicon/#:~:text=A%20custom%20favicon%20is%20a,of%20SVG%2C%20a%20vector%20format)

Also it's very common to build square or circle images holding a single alphabetic upper case letter for user profiles, website logos, etc.

Given this need, this repo provides some common sq.svg and a c.svg for such needs.

## How to use

Take the template and replace the fill and the letter accordingly.

For example, circle-7047EB-E uses `#7047EB` as the fill and letter E.

square-000000-V uses `#000000` as the fill and letter V.

If you choose a bright-colored fill for the shape, you may need to change the ffffff fill for the text to something else.
